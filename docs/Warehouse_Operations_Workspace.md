# Warehouse operations — bounded implementation plan

The canonical entrypoint is `/dashboard/warehouse`. Company operations, driver work, customer self-service and finance remain intentional workspaces sharing business records, not separate applications.

## Finite scope and compatibility

| Existing feature | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Floor/order board | Replace inferred status lanes with fresh, cursor-paginated custody work and preflight. Counts describe the loaded page only. |
| Scanning | Retain identification by order number/parcel code within authorized custody discovery; scanning never accepts custody. Confirm the complete parcel set per order. No bulk execution. |
| Receiving/handover | Replace generic bulk status changes with receipt-backed intake, receive, transport nomination and last-mile nomination. Offers do not transfer custody; exact drivers accept in their workspace. |
| Cash | Link to canonical Service Cash. Parcel receipt/assignment never transfers money. |
| Manifest | Retain printable scoped work manifest. This is a page-bounded warehouse work list, not a claim of complete company/driver inventory or money owed. |
| Pickup-point customer delivery | Unavailable: no approved warehouse self-pickup custody transition. Do not restore generic delivered mutation. |
| Location administration | Existing manager warehouse workspace remains separate; creation grants no operational scope. |
| Customer portal | Remains self-service. Legacy generic status/payment presentation and selected-context compatibility need a separate review; not rewritten here. |

Milestones: (1) route-owned order modal regression; (2) minimal no-store custody read additions using existing authorization, no new mutation policy/schema; (3) shared responsive custody UI, immutable persisted intents and canonical warehouse replacement; (4) focused client and HTTP/PostgreSQL checks, documentation, scope review and normal push.

Reads need named order/warehouse/parcel projections and bounded authoritative internal-leg/accepted-driver selectors. Missing context or exact warehouse scope denies. Existing POST custody contract is unchanged: operationId, expectedEventId, expectedUpdatedAt and entire parcelIds plus action-specific targets. Persist before send, never replay automatically, never replace an uncertain intent. Confirmed retries remain historical receipts and do not establish current custody.

Rollout: deploy additive read API before the frontend. Existing driver consumers retain old preflight fields. No migration, permissions, scopes, owner policy, cash, proof or financial changes. No existing demo mutation is required for validation. External/browser visual verification is pending unless explicitly executed; source checks and synthetic PostgreSQL evidence cannot prove rendering.

# Warehouse operations UI — 2026-10-10

Current enforced integration: one canonical /dashboard/warehouse workspace for explicitly scoped warehouse staff and dispatch actors. Incoming pickup/accepted transport, warehouse-held work and pending nominations use durable custody phase, never inferred legacy status lanes. Exact order-number/parcel-code scanning is identification only. Per-order complete-parcel confirmation precedes intake, receive, linehaul nomination or last-mile nomination; offers retain warehouse custody until the exact typed driver accepts. Company scope alone cannot substitute for warehouse scope.

## API / rollout

- GET /api/orders/custody-work retains kind, limit (1–50), cursor and old response fields. Additive search (exact order number or parcel code, 1–120 characters) and warehouseId filters are authorized before SQL and bound into cursor identity. Absent filters preserve existing cursor context. Warehouse-held pending offers are visible without granting a new action.
- GET /api/orders/:id/custody retains updatedAt, custody, parcelIds and pickupTrackingId; adds orderNumber, status, authorized warehouse actions, named owned warehouses and parcelCode/pieceNo/pieceTotal. Names/parcel data load only after parent custody authorization.
- GET /api/orders/:id/custody-options: action dispatch or last-mile-offer, kind drivers or legs, limit 1–20, source/context-bound cursor. Exact warehouse action authority is required before selectors. Drivers revalidate accepted membership-specific eligibility and action key; legs are existing owned planned internal routes from current warehouse to an owned destination, excluding provider bookings. A bounded candidate page may be empty with a next cursor.
- All custody GETs send no-store. Existing POST /api/orders/:id/custody and its locking, expected state, whole parcels, immutable receipts/audit, notifications and analytics transactions are unchanged. No schema/migration/permission/profile change. Deploy additive reads before frontend.

## Client / compatibility

Use fresh selected session hooks and context/epoch-partitioned queries. Store immutable original operationId, order, action, expectedEventId/expectedUpdatedAt, entire parcel set and authoritative selected targets before sending, with readback and exclusive browser locks. No automatic retry or ambiguous-intent abandonment. Historical confirmed receipts never stand in for current state. Secure-origin Web Locks and functioning local storage are required to send. Context switches suppress late reads/confirmation and retain original partitioned intents.

/dashboard/warehouse/orders/:id bookmarks redirect to canonical ?custody= preflight. Generic warehouse detail capabilities no longer expose legacy status, assignment or cash mutations. Shared company dispatch keeps initial assignment and links to the same canonical custody workspace; its obsolete generic bulk-status controls/queries are removed. Location administration, Service Cash and Sales Invoices remain separate canonical screens. The invoice route owns ?order=; the shell guards both opening and child mounting, including stale modal state. Genuine generic-modal routes retain their behavior.

Retained: scoped discovery/preflight, named warehouse/driver/leg selection, parcel scanning, whole-order receiving/handover, page-bounded printable work manifest and valid bookmarks. Existing full driver-route manifests remain in authorized dispatch/driver-roster entrypoints. Removed: old warehouse status lanes/inferred metrics, first/shared-user warehouse selection, generic bulk transitions and duplicate cash queries/controls. Unavailable: warehouse customer self-pickup delivery, unapproved exception/return transitions, nomination cancellation/recovery, and creating transport plans without the existing separately authorized planning contract. No hidden new grants or company ownership for tenant-owned warehouses. Customer portal is intentionally separate; its use of shared identity customer hints and legacy query/presentation contracts needs a later scoped compatibility batch, not a rewrite here.

## Executed evidence

- Frontend: 18 distinct new focused cases (2 actual static React markup), plus 8 affected navigation regressions: 26 passing. Immutable reload/retry, storage failure, conflicting content/targets, context/late-response suppression, nomination versus acceptance, invoice modal route ownership, warehouse bookmark/capability containment and authorized deep links. Static markup is not browser/layout evidence.
- Backend: 24 distinct affected mocked/service/HTTP cases across custody-work, warehouse-custody-http, custody-receiving and custody-proof-preflight-http. Reruns counted once. Added search/filter cursor and options-route authorization/no-effects coverage.
- Actual Fastify HTTP injection + PostgreSQL: 6 distinct cases in cash-capability-postgres.integration.test.ts selected by 'warehouse UI HTTP:'. Controlled synthetic onboarding/profiles, warehouse-only origin and destination staff, exact zero-scope local/linehaul drivers. Discovery/scanning/preflight, foreign/wrong/missing scopes, bounded names/projections, complete-parcel denial, intake, linehaul offer/exact acceptance/receipt, local offer/acceptance, matching/conflicting retries and staff revocation. Whole-graph digests assert no writes for reads/rejections and original retries. One synthetic planned internal leg is a configuration prerequisite; this is not evidence of restored planning UI. No custody/obligation seed shortcuts.
- Final both repositories no-emit and focused frontend lint. No broad suite or external transport run.
- Three newly labeled loopback-only PostgreSQL instances used exclusively owned tmpfs. All applied 122 existing migrations only to prepare empty disposable fixtures; no schema change or new migration certification claimed. Cleanup verified for cp-verification-f3297b112329, cp-verification-ad62a92005bc and cp-verification-13d50445f4f4, no owned volumes/binds remain. First attempt failed test compilation (no cases); second exposed an incorrect expected error code. Final six pass without weakening unchanged-record assertions: after intake, fresh re-intake is denied at authorization (403), rather than later stale-state checking (409).

## Reused / limits

Existing custody concurrency/rollback, whole-parcel and outgoing-driver suspension recovery, pickup/proof/delivery, cash/invoice calculation and Socket.IO evidence is reused where execution code is unchanged. Storage, labels, Redis/provider boundaries are mocked/disabled in these focused tests. No real browser, keyboard/zoom/mobile, printing, S3, provider or native-device verification; visuals remain pending for user review, with no blocked channel retried. No exactly-once external-delivery or complete isolation claim. Read snapshots do not reserve custody; every mutation reloads and fences current authority/state. Incomplete/ambiguous intents still require the existing bounded reconciliation policy; no reset UI added. Manual demo/data, dirty dist and all blocked cleanup directories preserved. Review branches are confirmed review-only; no deployment authorized.

Finite batch complete after reviewed local checkpoints and normal publication. Next: external source/visual review; no next feature batch started.
